# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving

The Banking App project provides a tool to visualize and calculate the growth of investments over time. It solves the problem of understanding how different factors such as initial investment amount, monthly deposits, annual interest rates, and investment duration affect the overall growth of an investment. By displaying both with and without additional monthly deposits, it could allow for a user to better plan their investments in the long run.

# What did you do particularly well?

I implemented the core functionality of calculating and displaying investment growth over time. This was achieved primarily through the use of functions such as 'balanceNoMonthlyDeposit' and 'balanceWithMonthlyDeposit', ensuring that my code was as organized as possible with the resources and knowledge I had at the time.

# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

- Adding input validation and error handling to catch invalid inputs (e.g. negative numbers or non numeric inputs).
- Improving the user interface by providing more detailed instructions or a GUI effectively making the application more intuitive.
- Consolidating my repetitive code into reusable functions or methods would reduce redundant code.

# Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

Implementing the compound interest calculation with both monthly deposits and monthly compounding was a challenge. I overcame this by carefully following the formulas and testing with different values to ensure accuracy. Generally, I rely on programming documentation and online tutorials/forums to support my development process.

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

Writing functions to handle specific tasks and organizing my code for more maintanable software, as well as designing and implementing user prompts and managing input/output operations.

# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

- By dividing the functionality into separate functions the code remains organized and easier to maintain.
- Using fixed and setprecision ensures the output is consistently formatted.
- Including comments and using descriptive names for functions and variables help in understanding the purpose of each part of the code.
